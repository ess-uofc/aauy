I joined AAUY because when I was a freshman, the upper years helped me throughout my entire year, and without them I would not be able to be where I am. Now I cannot repay all the help they gave me, but what they did teach me to do is pass-on-the-torch, to help others now. And therefore I am more than happy to be a proud member of AAUY!
